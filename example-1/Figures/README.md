Save your figures here. This folder will grow _a lot_ over the course of your project, so be careful about naming your figures! A couple suggestions

- __Use subdirectories__: you may want to have, for example, a `descriptives` directory, a `main results` directory and a `robustness checks` directory

- Use sensible names! If you are producing similar plots you should use similar names, for example `coef_by_age.png` and `coef_by_country.png`, so that you kno what you are plotting and how the plots are different
