Put your scripts here.

This folder will grow _a lot_ as you progress with your project, so here are a couple suggestions:

- Use subdirectories! You can, for example, create a `cleaning` subdirectory that contains all data cleaning scripts, an `analysis` subdirectory that contains all the scripts that run your main analysis and so on

- __Number your scripts__: within each subdirectory have your scripts' name start with a two-digit number so that you know in which order to run them. Here you see that I started with `00`

- You can use the README to keep track of bugs and things to do
