# Examples of directories for research projects

These are some (mostly) empty directories which you can use as bases for papers/projects. 

The idea is to write a paper as a dynamic document using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) so to make it easier to update it, reproduce it and distribute it.

This also allows for collaboration with coauthors (through Git/GitHub) but the one thing that cannot be replicated from Overleaf is live editing of the same section of the paper at the same time.

## example-1

Sort of "brute force" approach to Quarto. 

TODO:

	- Styling of citations
	- Document templates (latex)
	- Render to html and add button for rendering to pdf
